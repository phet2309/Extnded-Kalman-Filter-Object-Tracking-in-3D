# Extnded-Kalman-Filter-Object-Tracking-in-3D
This project shows how object path can be trackesd and estimated by Extended Kalman Filter. 
An object is moving in 3D space and we want to track that by using Extended Kalman Filter ExtendedKalmanfiter.m is the main file which you have to run.
All other files are the dependency functions which are called in this ExtendedKalmanFilter.m file.
